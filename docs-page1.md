# Theme Park of Everyday
## Pocket Park iOS

PocketPark enables serendipitous moments of surprise and wonder by enabling your device to control the physical world. Using the frameworks available here and the [LightBlue Bean](<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LU46NLA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00LU46NLA&linkCode=as2&tag=theparofeve-20&linkId=PS5VC75DSSUOWYEQ">LightBlue Bean</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theparofeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00LU46NLA" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
), you can create your own installations as part of the Theme Park of Everyday.

## How it Works

Device Sensor + LightBlue Bean = Magic!

Using the sensors in your iOS device, you can control physical things wirelessly. The LightBlue Bean and bluetooth low energy is used to transfer sensor data which you translate to whatever you can imagine.
