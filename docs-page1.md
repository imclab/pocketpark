# Theme Park of Everyday


## Pocket Park iOS

PocketPark enables serendipitous moments of surprise and wonder by enabling your device to control the physical world. Using the frameworks available here and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LU46NLA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00LU46NLA&linkCode=as2&tag=theparofeve-20&linkId=PS5VC75DSSUOWYEQ">LightBlue Bean</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theparofeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00LU46NLA" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, you can create your own installations as part of the Theme Park of Everyday.

## How it Works

PocketPark for iOS enables anyone to instantly control your installation. 
> iOS Devices must be Bluetooth Low Energy enabled. iPhone 4S and newer.

Sensor information from the iOS device is sent to a installation via the LightBlue Bean, a Bluetooth Low Energy enabled Arduino.

The installation you create could be *anything*: a bubble machine controlled by blowing into the device microphone, a fire breathing dragon you wake up by waving at it, or everyone's favoriteâ€¦ LEDs.

You'll find example code to get started below.
