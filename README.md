# PocketPark

Why hasn’t it been feasible to bring interactive physical vignettes out of engineered spaces like theme parks and into daily life? Theme Park of Everyday explores how the devices in our pockets can augment and control the physical world. A series of installations and tools for anyone to contribute will depict how playful physical “micro-interactions” can be easily built and embedded into the city around us.

# LightBlue Bean
Installations are powered by the [LightBlue Bean](https://punchthrough.com/bean/) an awesome BLE Radio + Arduino for $30.
